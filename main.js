  this.velX = random(-7,7);
  this.velY = random(-7,7);
  // horizontal and vertical velocity (velX and velY) — each ball is given random values to represent its velocity; in real terms these values will be regularly added to the x/y coordinate values when we start to animate the balls, to move them by this much on each frame.

  ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  // Next, we use the arc() method to trace an arc shape on the paper. Its parameters are:
  // The x and y position of the arc's center — we are specifying our ball's x and y properties.
  // The radius of our arc — we are specifying our ball's size property.
  // The last two parameters specify the start and end number of degrees round the circle that the arc is drawn between. Here we specify 0 degrees, and 2 * PI, which is the equivalent of 360 degrees in radians (annoyingly, you have to specify this in radians). That gives us a complete circle. If you had specified only 1 * PI, you'd get a semi-circle (180 degrees).

  // Checking to see whether the x coordinate is smaller than 0 (the ball is going off the left hand edge).

  if((this.y - this.size) <= 0) {
    this.velY = -(this.velY);
  }
  // Checking to see whether the y coordinate is smaller than 0 (the ball is going off the top edge).

  // The first four parts of the function check whether the ball has reached the edge of the canvas. If it has, we reverse the polarity of the relevant velocity to make the ball travel in the opposite direction. So for example, if the ball was traveling upwards (positive velX), then the horizontal velocity is changed so that it starts to travel downwards instead.

  // In each case, we are including the size of the ball in the calculation because the x/y coordinates are in the center of the ball, but we want the edge of the ball to bounce off the perimeter — we don't want the ball to go halfway off the screen before it starts to bounce back.

  this.x += this.velX;
  this.y += this.velY;
  // The last two lines add the velX value to the x coordinate, and the velY value to the y coordinate — the ball is in effect moved each time this method is called.
